# foodhub
This is a review app created with the assistance of Flutter. I used the design from the following link:https://www.figma.com/community/file/1016293188579696778/food-app-foodhub-community. I've customized the design to transform it into a food review app. I've also attached a screenshot of the app for your reference. You can find the apk in the build folder
